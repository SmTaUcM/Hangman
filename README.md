# Hangman
C++ Version of Hangman

- **Description:** C++ Console graphics based hangman game.

- **What I Learned:** This project represents my first attempt at writing C++ code from scratch. Using a previously made Python implementation of Hangman. I proceeded to convert the code to C++. I further ehnaced my skills in writing pure C++ code by teaching myself concepts such as basic file I/O and list comprehension.
